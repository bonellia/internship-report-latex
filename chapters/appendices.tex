% Appendices (if any) -- listings, screen shots, diagrams, etc. 

% Final Remarks: 
% Your advisor may ask you to rewrite your reports. While re-writing the 
% reports: 
% Remove text that is not yours! Cut-n-pasted tutorials, web material, etc. is 
% not part of your report!  
% Write in detail, of what you've done in your summer practice. Using a step-
% by-step progress is a good way to do this.  
% Remove pages of source-code. Use screen shot, whose content explained in 
% captions, and other figures that contributed.  
% Properly format your reports!  
% The reports that are not written properly will be graded as unsatisfactory.
